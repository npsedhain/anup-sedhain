## the first time

### sketch -1 

The first memory of someone is **really** pure. It goes untapped and unadulterated into the fine pages of memory books. The process, the time beyond and after that may be tampered with tainted mixture. But the first glance remains as it is. Deeply knitted into your veins, and there is no unsewing it. It just stays. Almost calms you when you feel that the present has become treacherous. Memory of that first glimpse always puts a grin in your face. It makes you **glad** that all of **it**, has **happened**.
