## story never ends

#### sketch - 3

A song is stuck in my head. I am singing it. I know, I know, if you were here, you would have hated it. You have told me enough that I am a bad singer. But I would sing nonetheless and feel far from embarrassed - this is what I miss.

I also know what they say - "Times change.", "Things don’t last", "Memories fade.", and so on. But what I remember is our stories. 
And **the story never endsss ♬♬♬**

## the first time

#### sketch - 2

The first memory of someone is **really** pure. It goes untapped and unadulterated into the fine pages of memory books. The process, the time beyond and after that may be tampered with tainted mixture. But the first glance remains as it is. Deeply knitted into your veins, and there is no unsewing it. It just stays. Almost calms you when you feel that the present has become treacherous. Memory of that first glimpse always puts a grin in your face. It makes you **glad** that all of **it**, has **happened**.

## is it chaotic?

#### sketch - 1 

Nobody loves **chaos**. But many people think they(or their lives) are in a state of this complete disorder. Is it that they don’t try or **is** it something completely un**avoidable** to have to be living in this mayhem? It’s one of the things we need to invest some time thinking.
To me there isn’t a state of chaos, at least not in our lives. It’s because of this overwhelming options we see before us, and fall into the illusion of indecisiveness. But we really haven’t been looking, the thing we need isn’t the crowd, it’s just a piece of it.
**Concentrate** **on** just the things you know you **need** and life isn’t that chaotic at all.
