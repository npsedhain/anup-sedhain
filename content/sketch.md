## i don't know

#### sketch - 8

An inevitable truth about us social beings is that we all want to sound smart. From our early childhood to the end of life, we are seeking validation, trying to feed our egos and hoping to be correct, always. A nod in the face, a hint of approval in the eyes, are all that we wish we would get from people. Amidst all that, where we miss out is being really smart. 

We are focused in the result. We hear people talking and spitting great values and the next thing we do is copy. We speak up about things we feel is correct. While that's not absolutely wrong but we fail to see the underlying truth. What made the person be on the stands and speak what he speaks? Who gave him the right and authority to be there and make us listen? Well, it's not the action in itself but the whole process behind it that's important. When we are really trying to sound smart we fail to put real effort in being one.

But you are here reading this and if you really want to be smart. Then remember that the real difference between sounding smart and being smart is - I don't know. So, make sure you know what **you don't know**.

## a note to you and i

#### sketch - 7

I hate to admit this, but I am slowly losing respect for you. You have been great, perhaps helped me a lot. But I barely feel it. It makes me happy to see you happy, but you are making it difficult. I would try to help you, but you don't want it. Heck, you don't even realise that you need help. To you, the world is wrong and you are correct. I obliged, I hid your darkest secret. I tried to empathise, to put myself in your shoes but you are making it harder. People around you are trying their best, only to realise you are failing them. Open your eyes and see what you are doing and what you are missing. We have given ample hints, we have shouted, but you don't comply. You open your defense suit and that is where everything goes wrong. Learn to digest criticisms. Its really getting out of hands, don't make us hate you, don't distance yourself too much. There are better ways for you to communicate. Its never too late to change, if you just realise you need to, we are here to help. Just embrace yourself with your flaws. I beg you.

## selfish relation

#### sketch - 6

Be open about what you want. Be clear from the moment go. Tell the person what you need and pay attention to their likes/dislikes. Don't just listen; understand and help them understand your needs and emotions. Feed the person's ego and let her/him feed yours. Help the person get through her/his dreadful times with a promise that s/he will do the same for you. The love you so dearly wanted to work, will work. It will be driven by your selfishness and it will be just as beautiful. Because love doesn't have to be selfless, it is about serving you the way that works for both. If you take, you must give and that should work.

## positive illusion

#### sketch - 5

Before you take an IQ test, guess the score you think you will get. Now, ask one of your acquaintances (doesn't have to be close) to guess it too. Researches have found that, you are most likely to be less accurate than other person who had also guessed it. It's because you know yourself too well and you have a higher perception of yourself than you really are. There is a term for something like this, and it's called **positive illusion**. We are all the victim of it. Perhaps, me more than you.

## my day off

#### sketch - 4

“It’s all worth it - hustling - will certainly pay off one day.”

While this is true to its core, it has started occurring to me that balance in life is just as important. Can you **remember** the last time you spent time with your family, and asked how your mother has been? If it has been a while, you should consider taking these acts as just as indispensible as work. Yes, working day-and-night will reap fruits but it shouldn’t be at an expense of life.

While I was reading somewhere that the sky was beautiful today, it struck me - I could just read, and that was it. I thought I was sacrificing the time for something far greater that these smaller things would never matter. I was wrong. What about those glimpses of the beautiful sky, **the silver linings** in the cloud, and the smile on your mother's face **?** In the end, these are what that matters the most. So, there should not be anything so demanding of you that you have to let these go. You can and you should find time for these.

Lately, I have been doing it wrong. It isn't the best of ways to make up for it but soon enough I will dedicate a day to just stare up at the sky and play ludo with my mom. That day, I will call it my day off.

## story never ends

#### sketch - 3

A song is stuck in my head. I am singing it. I know, I know, if you were here, you would have hated it. You have told me enough that I am a bad singer. But I would sing nonetheless and feel far from embarrassed - this is what I miss.

I also know what they say - "Times change.", "Things don’t last", "Memories fade.", and so on. But what I remember is our stories. 
And **the story never endsss ♬♬♬**

## the first time

#### sketch - 2

The first memory of someone is **really** pure. It goes untapped and unadulterated into the fine pages of memory books. The process, the time beyond and after that may be tampered with tainted mixture. But the first glance remains as it is. Deeply knitted into your veins, and there is no unsewing it. It just stays. Almost calms you when you feel that the present has become treacherous. Memory of that first glimpse always puts a grin in your face. It makes you **glad** that all of **it**, has **happened**.

## is it chaotic?

#### sketch - 1

Nobody loves **chaos**. But many people think they(or their lives) are in a state of this complete disorder. Is it that they don’t try or **is** it something completely un**avoidable** to have to be living in this mayhem? It’s one of the things we need to invest some time thinking.

To me there isn’t a state of chaos, at least not in our lives. It’s because of this overwhelming options we see before us, and fall into the illusion of indecisiveness. But we really haven’t been looking, the thing we need isn’t the crowd, it’s just a piece of it.
**Concentrate** **on** just the things you know you **need** and life isn’t that chaotic at all.
