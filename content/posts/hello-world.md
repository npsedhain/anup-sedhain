![resam ra nun](/images/hello-world.jpg)

I had been meaning to do this for a long time now. I had always imagined having a great blog that connects the best of two worlds - **development** and **philosophy**.

But all this time I had done nothing but imagine. This is my first step towards bringing that to life. While I don't know how well I can mix the two, but I sure as hell gonna try. Perhaps, my first baby step, validates my motive - I am writing my thoughts down in a **Code Editor**. There you go I already blended the two. I will try to carry on with it. Meanwhile this is my first piece of literature here, so like in programming, **Hello** **_Another_** **World!**, it's nice to meet you.
